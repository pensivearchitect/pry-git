_A Ruby-aware git layer_

This fork of pry-git seeks to make use of the [gitsh](https://github.com/thoughtbot/gitsh) utility to extend the gem's git integration

Now back to the original Readme

Retrieve blame, perform diffs, make commits using the natural units of
Ruby code.

pry-git enables you to diff an individual _method_ , it can show you
the blame for a method  and ultimately allow you to commit 'methods' (rather than amorphous
'hunks' of code).

pry-git is a plugin for the [pry](http://pry.github.com)
REPL.

pry-git is very much proof of concept right now, stay tuned!

* Install the [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/pry-git): `gem install pry-git`
* See the [source code](http://github.com/pry/pry-git)

Example: blame
--------

    pry(main)> git blame Pry#repl
    John Mair   def repl(target=TOPLEVEL_BINDING)
    John Mair     target = Pry.binding_for(target)
    John Mair     target_self = target.eval('self')
    John Mair
    John Mair     repl_prologue(target)
    Mon ouÃ¯e
    John Mair     # cannot rely on nesting.level as
    John Mair     # nesting.level changes with new sessions
    John Mair     nesting_level = nesting.size
    John Mair
    John Mair     break_data = catch(:breakout) do
    John Mair       nesting.push [nesting.size, target_self, self]
    John Mair       loop do
    John Mair         rep(target)
    John Mair       end
    John Mair     end
    John Mair
    John Mair     return_value = repl_epilogue(target, nesting_level, break_data)
    Lee Jarvis    return_value || target_self
    John Mair   end

Example: diff
--------

    pry(main)> git diff Pry#repl
       def repl(target=TOPLEVEL_BINDING)
    +
    +    # hey baby
         target = Pry.binding_for(target)
         target_self = target.eval('self')

    +    # bink
         repl_prologue(target)

         # cannot rely on nesting.level as
         # nesting.level changes with new sessions
         nesting_level = nesting.size

         break_data = catch(:breakout) do
           nesting.push [nesting.size, target_self, self]
           loop do
             rep(target)
           end
         end

         return_value = repl_epilogue(target, nesting_level, break_data)
         return_value || target_self
       end

Example: add
--------

Note that `.git` invokes the system `git` command (a `.` prefix
forwards the line to the shell, see: [shell commands](https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/Shell-Integration#Execute_shell_commands))

    pry(main) git add Pry#repl
    pry(main) .git diff --cached
    diff --git a/lib/pry/pry_instance.rb b/lib/pry/pry_instance.rb
    index 7a4c403..6483a4a 100644
    --- a/lib/pry/pry_instance.rb
    +++ b/lib/pry/pry_instance.rb

Features and limitations
-------------------------

* Just a proof of concept at this stage.
* The methods you're invoking the git commands on must be part of a
  git repo (of course).
* Commands currently just work with respect to `HEAD`; this
  restriction will be lifted in a later version.
* BETA software, beware!
